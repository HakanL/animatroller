This is not a DMX GUI like the excellent Light-O-Rama, Vixen Lights, Lightjams or similar applications. Instead this system is to build interactive displays based on simple C# code.\r\n\r\n### History\r\nFor Halloween 2012 I was planning to have a pressure mat activate a sequence that would turn on lights, strobes, pneumatics and a skeleton moving along a track in the ceiling. I was going through the selection of great software that's available for creating Christmas displays, but I didn't find something that had easy support for triggers. Also the GUI nature of those applications meant I had to move multiple channels left and right just to get the timing right. Since I'm a C# developer I figured I can apply those skills and build an extensive framework where I'm in full control.\r\n\r\nFor Christmas 2012 I used the same system to control my Christmas lights, including synchronized lights/music.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nClick [here](https://github.com/HakanL/animatroller/wiki/Features) for a list of features in the Wiki.\r\n\r\n### Forums\r\nDiscuss features and get help at the [forums](http://animatroller.vanillaforfree.com).\r\n\r\n### Wiki\r\nMain Wiki page: [Wiki](https://github.com/HakanL/animatroller/wiki) with links to [Getting Started](https://github.com/HakanL/animatroller/wiki/Get-Started), etc.\r\n\r\n### Source Code\r\nFull source code is available on my github page: [github.com/HakanL/animatroller](https://github.com/HakanL/animatroller)","name":"Animatroller","google":"UA-37497327-1"}
